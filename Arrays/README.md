>bubble sort 
-swap the to two adjust element keeping smaller element in left side.
and have to move to the end of the arrays 
>selection sort
-intuition is to compare each element with every element to find the least/highest element.

=>what is the process?
- consider finding the least element {it will be places at index 0}
- first iteration
    -search in array for least element to replace it at index 0.

    if found - replace the element with element at index 0.  && move to second iteration
    if not - move to second iteration.

    repeat with each element present in array.

    by each passing iteration we are findind just greater number than last least number.

>Insertion sort
-two processes are there .
1. extend the window 
2. swap to find the right place.
